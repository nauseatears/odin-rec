    <p>Delightful little tarts with pineapple filling and a cross on the top.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 cup self-rising flour </li>
        <li>10 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold water </li>
        <li>1 pinch salt </li>
        <li>2 cups fresh pineapple - peeled, cored and shredded </li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar </li>
        <li>4 whole cloves </li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine all-purpose, self-rising flour and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour in 1 beaten egg and water. Bind the ingredients together gently. Do not knead too much. Shape dough into a ball, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.</li>

        <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, combine pineapple and sugar. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring frequently, for 30 minutes, or until mixture thickens. Remove from heat and allow to cool.</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch in thickness. Cut 24 rounds, using a 2 inch round fluted cutter. Place on cookie sheet. Put a spoonful of pineapple jam in the center of each piece. Decorate with criss-cross strips of pastry over jam, extending slightly onto pastry shell.</li>

        <li>Cut 24 more 2 inch rounds, then, using a smaller cutter, cut out the centers, creating a ring shape. Moisten the edges of each pastry, and place the rings on top of each pastry shell. Brush the top of the pastry with beaten egg.</li>

        <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
